### Retrospective Feedback Collector

We collect sprint retrospective feedback in [a repo in MIT Github](https://github.mit.edu/odl-engineering/retrospectives/issues/). This feedback is collected as comments on an issue that is created for each individual retro meeting. There are a few categories of feedback, and it helps to see all of the feedback collected into one comment and broken out by category.

The gist above contains the script and instructions for gathering and categorizing feedback for a retrospective issue.
